A test-suite for the uCini library

Uses uCini as a submodule from http://subogero.dyndns.org/git/uCini.git
Shows an example mapping for all internal data types.
First dumps all internal data to stdout,
then reads input from stdin in ini format,
then dumps the changed internal data to stdout again.
